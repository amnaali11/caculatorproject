<h1>what is machine learning?</h1>
“Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion,
by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.”
The above definition encapsulates the ideal objective or ultimate aim of machine learning, as expressed by many researchers in the field. 
The purpose of this article is to provide a business-minded reader with expert perspective on how machine learning is defined, and how it works. Machine learning and artificial intelligence share the same definition in the minds of many however, there are some distinct differences readers should recognize as well.
References and related researcher interviews are included at the end of this article for further digging.

<h1>How We Arrived at Our Definition:</h1>
(Our aggregate machine learning definition can be found at the beginning of this article)
As with any concept, machine learning may have a slightly different definition, depending on whom you ask.
We combed the Internet to find five practical definitions from reputable sources:
<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Machine Learning at its most basic is the practice of using algorithms to parse data,
learn from  it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.”</li>
<li>“Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.” </li>
<li>“Machine learning is based on algorithms that can learn from data without relying on rules-based programming.”</li>
<li>“Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks by generalizing from examples.”</li> 
<li>“The field of Machine Learning seeks to answer the question “How can we build computer systems that automatically improve with experience, and what are the fundamental laws that govern all learning processes?”</li>
</ol><br>
We sent these definitions to experts whom we’ve interviewed and/or included in one of our past research consensuses, 
and asked them to respond with their favorite definition or to provide their own. Our introductory definition is meant to reflect the varied responses.
Below are some of their responses:
<font color="blue">Dr. Yoshua Bengio</font>, Université de Montréal:<br>
ML should not be defined by negatives (thus ruling 2 and 3). Here is my definition:
Machine learning research is part of research on artificial intelligence, seeking to provide knowledge to computers through data, observations and interacting with the world. 
That acquired knowledge allows computers to correctly generalize to new settings.<br>
<font color="blue">Dr. Danko Nikolic</font>, CSC and Max-Planck Institute:
(edit of number 2 above): “Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed,
but instead letting them learn a few tricks on their own.
<font color="blue">Dr. Roman Yampolskiy</font>, University of Louisville:
Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn as well as humans do or better.

<h1>Machine Learning Basic Concepts</h1>
There are many different types of machine learning algorithms, with hundreds published each day, and they’re typically grouped by either learning style (i.e. supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning) or by similarity in form or function (i.e. classification, regression, decision tree, clustering, deep learning, etc.).
Regardless of learning style or function, all combinations of machine learning algorithms consist of the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Representation (a set of classifiers or the language that a computer understands)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evaluation (aka objective/scoring function)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Optimization (search method; often the highest-scoring classifier, for example; there are both off-the-shelf and custom optimization methods used)</strong></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>Visual Representations of Machine Learning Models</h1>
Concepts and bullet points can only take one so far in understanding. When people ask “What is machine learning?”, they often want to see what it is and what it does.
Below are some visual representations of machine learning models, with accompanying links for further information.

<h1>How We Get Machines to Learn</h1>
There are different approaches to getting machines to learn, from using basic decision trees to clustering to layers of artificial neural networks (the latter of which has given way to deep learning), 
depending on what task you’re trying to accomplish and the type and amount of data that you have available. This dynamic sees itself played out in applications as varying as medical diagnostics or self-driving cars. 
While emphasis is often placed on choosing the best learning algorithm, researchers have found that some of the most interesting questions arise out of none of the available machine learning algorithms performing to par. 
Most of the time this is a problem with training data, but this also occurs when working with machine learning in new domains.
Research done when working on real applications often drives progress in the field, and reasons are twofold:
<ol>
<li>Tendency to discover boundaries and limitations of existing methods.</li> 
<li>Researchers and developers working with domain experts and leveraging time and expertise to improve system performance.</li>
</ol>
Sometimes this also occurs by “accident.” We might consider model ensembles, or combinations of many learning algorithms to improve accuracy, to be one example. Teams competing for the 2009 Netflix Price found that they got their best results when combining their learners with other team’s learners, resulting in an improved recommendation algorithm (read Netflix’s blog for more on why they didn’t end up using this ensemble).
One important point (based on interviews and conversations with experts in the field), in terms of application within business and elsewhere, is that machine learning is not just, or even about, automation, an often misunderstood concept. If you think this way, you’re bound to miss the valuable insights that machines can provide and the resulting opportunities (rethinking an entire business model, for example, as has been in industries like manufacturing and agriculture).
Machines that learn are useful to humans because, with all of their processing power, they’re able to more quickly highlight or find patterns in big (or other) data that would have otherwise been missed by human beings. Machine learning is a tool that can be used to enhance humans’ abilities to solve problems and make informed inferences on a wide range of problems, from helping diagnose diseases to coming up with solutions for global climate change.

<h1>Challenges and Limitations</h1>
Machine learning can’t get something from nothing…what it does is get more from less.” – Dr. Pedro Domingo, University of Washington
The two biggest, historical (and ongoing) problems in machine learning have involved overfitting (in which the model exhibits bias towards the training data and does not generalize to new data, and/or variance i.e. learns random things when trained on new data) and dimensionality (algorithms with more features work in higher/multiple dimensions, making understanding the data more difficult). Having access to a large enough data set has in some cases also been a primary problem.
One of the most common mistakes among machine learning beginners is testing training data successfully and having the illusion of success; Domingo (and others) emphasize the importance of keeping some of the data set separate when testing models, and only using that reserved data to test a chosen model, followed by learning on the whole data set.
When a learning algorithm (i.e. learner) is not working, often the quicker path to success is to feed the machine more data, the availability of which is by now well-known as a primary driver of progress in machine and deep learning algorithms in recent years; however, this can lead to issues with scalability, in which we have more data but time to learn that data remains an issue.
In terms of purpose, machine learning is not an end or a solution in and of itself. Furthermore, attempting to use it as a blanket solution i.e. “BLANK” is not a useful exercise; instead, coming to the table with a problem or objective is often best driven by a more specific question – “BLANK”.
